# stocks_ml
A series of machine learning experiments, to see what data points need to be included in a model to improve the accuracy of predicting stock trends.

## Experiment 1 - time sequence analysis using LSTMS
Eperiment one starts with an analysis of just a single data point, the daily closing market vlaue. Using LSTMs to build a two layer deep neural network (DNN).
